Some sample content, not mine, of course. ‘It can be a bit of a washing machine at the start, so just find your space and race your own race’, a triathlon friend said to me. I am at the starting line: wetsuit on, goggles on (fog, of course), surrounded by fellow athletes, there are people everywhere! Am on the right side of the starting group, a bit towards the back. I feel good, fit and energetic, and I know that the swim is my strongest discipline. Since it is my first triathlon, my motto is to ‘have fun and finish!’.

The starting signal is given (didn’t hear it) and the crowd starts to move into the shallow water. I see others walking or jogging in the water and I do the same. Until the water is at my hips and I dive in to start to swim. I see arms and legs and foam everywhere, in front of me, to my sides, people touching my legs, they are everywhere! I accidentally kick people (sorry!) and they kick me or hit me with their arms. ‘What the f…!’ I breathe at every stroke now and feel I am starting to panic. I try to swim away from the crowd and keep my eye on the safety jetski, there to provide assistance when needed. ‘

What is going on with me?’ I remember thinking, ‘I am a good swimmer, but am not moving forward at all.’ Then I realise that my breathing is completely out of control, and so is my heart-rate. I am at the verge of raising my hand to get the jetski to come for me. ‘Why on earth am I doing this, this does not fall under the category of fun in my book!’ My mind is playing games with me, trying to make me stop and get out of the water. Then I remember the other part of my aim for this first triathlon: ‘finish!’. I want to know how the complete triathlon goes: the transitions, the bike, the run, the finish. It is not about competing with the others, it is about competing with myself. About learning how this triathlon thing works. That word: ’finish’, keeps me going, somehow.

I then turn-over, lie on my back and drift in the sea for a bit, looking at the sky. ‘A washing machine? It felt more like being caught in a fish-tank full of piranhas!’ ‘Exhale’ the coach had said, so I put one hand on my heart and start to exhale and take a few deep breaths. And slowly but surely the breathing returns back to normal. Am at the back of the pack now, less people around me, flip over again and start to swim: one two three four, breathe. Before I know it, I am taking over people again until I reach land. I am dizzy but ok.
